SCOPE OF WORK
Project Title: Spanish-Speaking AI Voice Bot for In-Store Child Interaction (Local Setup)

Objective:
Develop a fully functional, Spanish-speaking AI voice bot named Ricoso designed to interact with children in a retail environment. The bot should be able to recognize spoken Spanish, respond using synthesized voice, log conversations, and run entirely on a local computer using a microphone and speaker setup. The final version must function offline and be safe, friendly, and responsive in real time.

DELIVERABLES & FEATURES
Voice Input & Recognition
- Real-time voice capture using a microphone
- Speech-to-text engine capable of Spanish recognition
- Option to use offline-capable STT tools such as Vosk or Whisper
- Bot actively listens and transcribes spoken input to text

Bot Response System
- Basic Spanish replies for introductory conversation
- Conditional logic to continue the conversation (e.g., greeting, favorite things)
- Child-appropriate tone and response flow
- Short interactive back-and-forth conversations (3–4 turns)
- Ability to understand and reply based on keywords or intent
- Simple dialogue tree or rules-based logic (not open-ended AI)

Voice Output (Text-to-Speech)
- Convert bot text replies into speech using Spanish TTS engine
- Use realistic, expressive deep male Spanish voice
- Support for both online and offline TTS options
- Low-latency voice generation to maintain natural timing

Offline Capability
- Entire system must run without internet in its final form
- Use local models for speech recognition and synthesis
- No third-party servers required during runtime

Conversation Logging
- Save both user speech input and bot replies to a .txt log file
- Log format includes timestamp and speaker identity (e.g., “Child” / “Ricoso”)
- Store logs in a local folder (e.g., Ricoso_Logs) in readable format

Child-Safety Features
- Basic language filtering to block inappropriate phrases or keywords
- Response filtering for emotional safety and kindness
- No personal data storage beyond local text logs

Additional Features
- Optional: Wake word detection (e.g., “Hola Ricoso”) to begin conversation
- Idle timeout system (e.g., pauses or resets if inactive for X seconds)
- Simple GUI (optional) or command-line interface with clear setup
- Clean codebase with modular structure for future expansion

FINAL DELIVERABLES
- Python source code with all scripts separated or modularized
- requirements.txt with full dependency list
- Folder structure including logs, assets, and configuration
- Setup guide or README for local installation and usage
- Optional: Short demo video or screenshot to confirm functionality
